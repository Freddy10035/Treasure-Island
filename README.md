## RollerCoaster & Odd/Even Checker & BMI 2.0 & Leap Year Checker & Pizza Order Program & Treasure Island Game

This program is a combination of 6 different mini-programs, each with a different purpose. The first program is a RollerCoaster payment system that calculates the amount a person should pay for a ride based on their height and age. The second program checks whether a number entered is even or odd. The third program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their height and weight. The fourth program checks if a year entered is a leap year or not. Finally, the last program is an automatic pizza order system that calculates the price of a pizza order based on its size, toppings, and extra cheese.
